The Streams API provides two static methods to generate a stream from a function:
Stream.iterate and Stream.generate. These two operations let you create what we
call an infinite stream, a stream that doesn’t have a fixed size like when you create a
stream from a fixed collection. Streams produced by iterate and generate create
values on demand given a function and can therefore calculate values forever! It’s
generally sensible to use limit(n) on such streams to avoid printing an infinite number
of values.
